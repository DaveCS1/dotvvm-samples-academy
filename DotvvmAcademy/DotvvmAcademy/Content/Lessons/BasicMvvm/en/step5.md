ViewModel Command
=================
Now we need to write a method which calculates the sum of the two numbers. This method is also declared in our viewmodel.

So create a method called `Calculate` which calculates the sum of `Number1` and `Number2` and stores the result in the `Result` property.

[<sample Incorrect="../samples/Lesson1ViewModelStep5Incorrect.cs"
         Correct="../samples/Lesson1ViewModelStep5Correct.cs"
         Validator="Lesson1Step5Validator" />]

> The method should be public and it does not return any value.
