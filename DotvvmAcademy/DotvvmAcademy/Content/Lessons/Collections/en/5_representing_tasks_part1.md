Representing Tasks Part 1
=========================
We are ready to create a list of tasks. However, we need a class to represent the task itself.

Each task should have the `Title` property of `string`, and the `IsCompleted` property of `bool`.

Create a class named `TaskData` and declare the two properties.

[<CSharpExercise Initial="samples/TaskData_Stage1.cs"
                 Final="samples/TaskData_Stage2.cs"
                 DisplayName="TaskData.cs"
                 ValidatorId="Lesson2Step5Validator" />]

> In Visual Studio, this class would be declared in separate file.
