Representing Tasks
==================
We are ready to create a list of tasks. However, we need a class to represent the task itself.

Each task should have the `Title` property of `string`, and the `IsCompleted` property of `bool`.

Create a class named `TaskData` and declare the two properties.

[<sample Correct="../samples/TaskDataCorrect.cs"
         Incorrect="../samples/TaskDataIncorrect.cs"
         Validator="Lesson2Step5Validator" />]


> In Visual Studio, this class would be declared in separate file.
