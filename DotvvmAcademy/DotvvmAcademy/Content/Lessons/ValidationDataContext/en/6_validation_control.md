Validator Control
=================
If you just need to display an error message, you can use the `dot:Validator` control.

There are the `ShowErrorMessageText` and `SetToolTipText` properties. If they are set, the error message generated by the `[Required]` attribute will be displayed in the `Validator` control or is set as a tool tip text on the element.

To learn more about the `Validator` control, read the [documentation](https://www.dotvvm.com/docs/controls/builtin/Validator/latest).
