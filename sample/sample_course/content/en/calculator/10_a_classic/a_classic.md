# A Classic

For this sample Lesson, we're gonna implement a simple calculator, the most classic of all apps.
It should be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

Let's start by creating a ViewModel stub. Go ahead and write down a declaration for a new class `CalculatorViewModel`
in the `SampleCourse` namespace.
