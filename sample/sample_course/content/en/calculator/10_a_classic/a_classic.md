# A Classic

In this sample Lesson, we're gonna implement a simple calculator, the most classic of all introductory apps
besides "Hello, World". It should be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

Let's start by creating a ViewModel stub. Go ahead and create a declaration for a new class called `CalculatorViewModel`
in the `SampleCourse` namespace.
