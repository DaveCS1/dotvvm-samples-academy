# Methods

Our calculator is gonna need some actual logic, isn't it?

Add these four `void`-returning methods:

- `Add()`
- `Subtract()`
- `Multiply()`
- `Divide()`

None of them is to have any parameters as they should operate on `LeftOperand` and `RightOperand` and save the result,
unsurprisingly, to the `Result` property.
