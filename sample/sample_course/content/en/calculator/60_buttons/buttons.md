# Buttons

At last, we get to add some `<dot:Button>`s that are gonna call the methods we created earlier.

Apart from the controls we added to the `<body>` element earlier, it should now also contain 4 `<dot: Buttons>` with
command bindings such as: `{command: Add()}` (one for every arithmetic operation) and `Text` properties set to either 
'+', '-', '*' or '/' as appropriate.
