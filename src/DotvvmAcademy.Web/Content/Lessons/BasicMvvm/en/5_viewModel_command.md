ViewModel Command
=================
Now we need to write a method which calculates the sum of the two numbers. This method is also declared in our viewmodel.

So create a method called `Calculate` which calculates the sum of `Number1` and `Number2` and stores the result in the `Result` property.

[<CSharpExercise Initial="samples/CalculatorViewModel_Stage3.cs"
                 Final="samples/CalculatorViewModel_Stage4.cs"
                 DisplayName="CalculatorViewModel.cs"
                 ValidatorId="Lesson1Step5Validator" />]

> The method should be public and it does not return any value.
