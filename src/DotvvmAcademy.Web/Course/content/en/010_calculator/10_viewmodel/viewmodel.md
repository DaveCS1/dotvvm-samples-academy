# The ViewModel

Hello and welcome to the first lesson of DotVVM Academy! We're going to explore DotVVM's most important concepts by building a calculator.

DotVVM is a web framework following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) software pattern, which divides objects into three groups: Models, Views, and [ViewModels]. Let's get familiar with the ViewModel group.

ViewModels are just plain old C# classes that contain public properties and methods. Our calculator needs three public integer properties named `Result`, `Number1`, and `Number2`. Add them to the `CalculatorViewModel` class. Don't forget to add getters and setters!
