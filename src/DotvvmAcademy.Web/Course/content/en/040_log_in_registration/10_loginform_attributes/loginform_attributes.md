# Log-In Form Attributes

Greetings! Validation is an important part of any form. Nowhere is it as important as in a Log-In & Registration Form. That's what we're going to build now.

The easiest way to validate anything is using `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` attributes. Add `[Required]` and `[Email]` attribute to `LogIn.Email` and `[Required]` `LogIn.Password`.
