# The ViewModel

Hello and welcome to the first lesson of DotVVM Academy! To explore DotVVM's most important concepts, we're going to build a calculator.

DotVVM is a web framework following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) software pattern, which divides objects into three groups: Models, Views, and ViewModels. We'll start with the ViewModel group.

ViewModels in DotVVM are just plain old C# classes. Add three public integer properties named `Result`, `Number1`, and `Number2` to the class below. Don't forget about their getters and setters!
