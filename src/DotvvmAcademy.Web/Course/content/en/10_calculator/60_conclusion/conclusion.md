# Conclusion

Congratulations! You successfully created a simplistic, yet functional, calculator!

You learned that DotVVM is an MVVM web framework. Views are what the users interact with. And ViewModels contain data and logic for Views to use. 

You may still ask: But what about Models? Models are whatever ViewModels use to get the job done, i.e. databases, payment gates, mailing clients, etc.

We also explored some of the features Dothtml has to offer such as: Directives, Bindings, and Controls.
