# Conclusion

This lesson covered a lot of ground. You should be proud of yourself. You learned how to:

- Use external Facades and DTOs
- Resolve services using Constructor Dependency Injection
- Leverage the `DotvvmViewModelBase` class
- Use the `Repeater` control and deal with its `DataContext` change

However, make no mistake. There's still a long way ahead of you.
