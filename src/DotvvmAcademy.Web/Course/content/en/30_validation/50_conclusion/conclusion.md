# Conclusion

Congratulations! You just learned that:

- `DataAnnotation` attributes are easy to use but cannot be customised
- `Validation.Target` is used to separate multiple validation areas
- `Validator` and `ValidationSummary` are used to display the errors
- `IValidatableObject` allows you to create a custom validation process

You can also add errors to `ModelState` during commands, which is helpful since that way your validation process can be asynchronous.
