# Prerequisites

There are some things you need to know before you can learn how to build apps in DotVVM:

- HTML & CSS - how to write static pages along with stylesheets
- C# - how to declare a class with properties and methods

If you don't know either of them, don't despair, there are places where you can learn them.
[SoloLearn], for instance, has nice interactive tutorials for absolute beginners.
