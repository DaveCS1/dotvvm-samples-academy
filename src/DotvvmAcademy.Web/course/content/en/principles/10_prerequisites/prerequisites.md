To illustrate the Principles of DotVVM, we're gonna build a Calculator.

However, there are some things you should be able to do before we start:

- [C#] - declare a class with properties and methods

If you don't know either of them, don't despair, there are places where you can learn them.
[SoloLearn], for instance, has nice interactive tutorials for absolute beginners.
