# Methods

Before we use the next [Dothtml] feature, our `CalculatorViewModel` needs to be able to actually calculate something.

---

## Your Task

Add four methods one for each of the four basic arithmetic operations that:

- Take no parameters and return `void`
- Are called `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, and `Divide`
- Combine `LeftOperand` and `RightOperand` and save the result into `Result`
